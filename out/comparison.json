    "res": "Functional Programming (FP) is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state or mutable data. It is based on the concept of mathematical functions which are deterministic and produce the same output for the same input, without causing side effects.\n\nHere are some key concepts and characteristics of Functional Programming:\n\n1. **First-Class and Higher-Order Functions**: Functions are first-class citizens in FP, meaning they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions. Higher-order functions are functions that take other functions as arguments or return them as results.\n\n2. **Pure Functions**: A pure function is one that, given the same input, will always return the same output and does not have any side effects (e.g., modifying a global variable or performing I/O operations).\n\n3. **Immutability**: Data is immutable in FP, meaning once a data structure is created, it cannot be changed. Instead of modifying existing data, new data structures are created.\n\n4. **Referential Transparency**: An expression is referentially transparent if it can be replaced with its value without changing the program's behavior. This is a direct consequence of using pure functions.\n\n5. **Function Composition**: Functions can be composed to build more complex functions. Function composition is the process of combining two or more functions to produce a new function.\n\n6. **Declarative Code**: FP emphasizes what to do rather than how to do it (which is more common in imperative programming). This often leads to more readable and concise code.\n\n7. **Recursion**: FP often relies on recursion rather than loops for iteration, as loops typically involve mutable state.\n\n8. **Lazy Evaluation**: Some functional languages support lazy evaluation, where expressions are not evaluated until their values are needed. This can improve performance by avoiding unnecessary calculations.\n\nPopular languages that support functional programming include Haskell, Lisp, Erlang, Scala, and F#. Many modern programming languages, such as JavaScript, Python, and Java, also incorporate functional programming features.\n\n### Example in Haskell:\nHere's a simple example of a pure function in Haskell:\n\n```haskell\nadd :: Int -> Int -> Int\nadd x y = x + y\n```\n\n### Example in JavaScript:\nJavaScript supports functional programming features as well. Here's an example using higher-order functions:\n\n```javascript\nconst add = (x) => (y) => x + y;\n\nconst increment = add(1);\nconsole.log(increment(5)); // 6\n```\n\n### Benefits of Functional Programming:\n- **Modularity**: Functions can be easily reused and combined in different ways.\n- **Maintainability**: Pure functions and immutability make reasoning about code easier.\n- **Concurrency**: Immutability and lack of side effects make it easier to write concurrent and parallel programs.\n- **Testability**: Pure functions are easier to test because they always produce the same output for the same input.\n\nIn summary, Functional Programming offers a different approach to writing software by focusing on functions, immutability, and declarative constructs, which can lead to more robust, maintainable, and scalable code."

    "res": "## Functional Programming in TypeScript for Rustaceans\n\nThis guide will walk you through building a TypeScript application using Functional Programming (FP) principles, catering specifically to developers familiar with Rust's strict type system and love for immutability.\n\n**Why FP in TypeScript?**\n\nTypeScript, while not inherently a functional language, offers features conducive to FP:\n\n* **Strong typing:** Like Rust, TypeScript provides static typing, enabling compile-time error catching and improved code clarity.\n* **Immutability (partially):** Using libraries like `immutable.js`, we can enforce immutability for data structures, preventing unintended side effects.\n* **Higher-order functions:** TypeScript supports functions as first-class citizens, allowing for elegant composition and data transformation.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n* **Immutability:**  Data structures should not be modified after creation. Use libraries like `immutable.js` or create immutable data structures manually.\n* **Pure Functions:** Functions should have no side effects, returning the same output for the same input every time.\n* **Function Composition:** Combine smaller, focused functions to create more complex logic.\n* **Currying:** Break down functions with multiple arguments into a series of unary functions.\n\n**Setting up your environment:**\n\n1. **Install Node.js and npm:**  [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)\n2. **Initialize a new project:** `npm init -y`\n3. **Install TypeScript:** `npm install -D typescript`\n4. **Create a `tsconfig.json` file:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"target\": \"es6\",\n    \"module\": \"commonjs\",\n    \"strict\": true,\n    \"noImplicitAny\": true,\n    \"strictNullChecks\": true,\n    \"outDir\": \"./dist\"\n  },\n  \"include\": [\n    \"./src/**/*\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Immutability with `immutable.js`:**\n\n```typescript\nimport { Map } from 'immutable';\n\nconst originalMap = Map({ key1: 'value1', key2: 'value2' });\nconst updatedMap = originalMap.set('key1', 'updatedValue');\n\nconsole.log(originalMap === updatedMap); // false\nconsole.log(originalMap.get('key1')); // 'value1'\nconsole.log(updatedMap.get('key1')); // 'updatedValue'\n```\n\n**Pure Functions:**\n\n```typescript\nfunction sum(a: number, b: number): number {\n  return a + b;\n}\n```\n\n**Function Composition:**\n\n```typescript\nconst addOne = (x: number): number => x + 1;\nconst double = (x: number): number => x * 2;\n\nconst addOneAndDouble = (x: number): number => double(addOne(x));\n\nconsole.log(addOneAndDouble(5)); // 12\n```\n\n**Currying:**\n\n```typescript\nconst sumThreeNumbers = (a: number) => (b: number) => (c: number) => a + b + c;\n\nconst sumWith1 = sumThreeNumbers(1);\nconst sumWith1And2 = sumWith1(2);\nconst finalSum = sumWith1And2(3);\n\nconsole.log(finalSum); // 6\n```\n\n**Example: Building a Todo List Application:**\n\n```typescript\nimport { List, Map } from 'immutable';\n\n// Type definitions\ntype Todo = {\n  id: number;\n  text: string;\n  completed: boolean;\n};\n\ntype State = Map<string, List<Todo>>;\n\n// Initial state\nconst initialState: State = Map({\n  todos: List(),\n});\n\n// Actions\ntype Action =\n  | { type: 'ADD_TODO'; text: string }\n  | { type: 'TOGGLE_TODO'; id: number };\n\n// Reducer\nconst reducer = (state: State = initialState, action: Action): State => {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'ADD_TODO':\n      return state.set(\n        'todos',\n        state.get('todos').push({\n          id: state.get('todos').size,\n          text: action.text,\n          completed: false,\n        })\n      );\n    case 'TOGGLE_TODO':\n      return state.set(\n        'todos',\n        state.get('todos').map((todo) =>\n          todo.id === action.id ? { ...todo, completed: !todo.completed } : todo\n        )\n      );\n    default:\n      return state;\n  }\n};\n\n// Example usage\nconst newState = reducer(initialState, { type: 'ADD_TODO', text: 'Learn FP' });\nconsole.log(newState.get('todos').toJS());\n```\n\n**Tips for Strict Type Safety:**\n\n* **Use TypeScript's strict mode:** This enforces stricter type checking and helps catch potential errors.\n* **Define types for everything:** Explicitly define types for variables, functions, and data structures.\n* **Utilize type guards:** Use type guards to narrow down types within conditional statements.\n* **Leverage generics:**  Create reusable functions and data structures that work with various types.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile TypeScript doesn't enforce FP paradigms as strictly as Rust, it provides enough tools to build applications with a functional flavor. By embracing immutability, pure functions, and function composition, you can create robust and maintainable applications that resonate with your Rust development experience. \n"

    "res": "## Building TypeScript Applications with Functional Programming: A Guide for Rust Developers\n\nThis guide aims to help Rust developers transition to TypeScript development with a functional programming (FP) approach. We'll focus on leveraging TypeScript's strong type system for safe and predictable code.\n\n**1. Understanding the Key Concepts**\n\n* **Immutability:**  Just like in Rust, strive to make data immutable by default. This prevents accidental modifications and promotes predictable behavior. \n* **Pure Functions:** Functions should always produce the same output for the same input, without side effects. This makes code easier to reason about and test.\n* **Composition:** Build complex logic by composing smaller, reusable functions. This enhances code modularity and maintainability.\n* **Data Structures:** Utilize immutable data structures like tuples, arrays, and objects, along with higher-order functions to manipulate them.\n* **Types:** TypeScript's type system provides static guarantees for data types, ensuring type safety throughout your application.\n\n**2. Setting Up Your Project**\n\n* **Create a new project:** Use `npm init -y` or `yarn init -y` to initialize a new project.\n* **Install TypeScript:**  Install the TypeScript compiler globally: `npm install -g typescript`.\n* **Configure tsconfig.json:** Create a `tsconfig.json` file with the following settings:\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"compilerOptions\": {\n      \"target\": \"es5\",\n      \"module\": \"commonjs\",\n      \"strict\": true,\n      \"noImplicitAny\": true,\n      \"noImplicitThis\": true,\n      \"noUnusedLocals\": true,\n      \"noUnusedParameters\": true,\n      \"esModuleInterop\": true,\n      \"forceConsistentCasingInFileNames\": true,\n      \"outDir\": \"dist\",\n      \"sourceMap\": true\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n  These settings enforce strict type checking, eliminate implicit types, and ensure your code is well-structured.\n\n**3. Embracing Functional Programming**\n\n* **Immutable Data:** Use `const` for variables to ensure immutability. For objects, use `Object.freeze()` to prevent modifications.\n* **Pure Functions:** Define functions that take arguments and return a value without side effects.\n* **Higher-Order Functions:** Utilize functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions. Common examples include `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, and `compose`.\n* **Data Structures:** Leverage immutable data structures like `ReadonlyArray` for arrays and `Readonly<T>` for objects.\n\n**4. Leveraging TypeScript's Type System**\n\n* **Type Inference:** TypeScript often infers types automatically, reducing the need for explicit type annotations.\n* **Union Types:**  Combine multiple types to represent a value that can be one of them.\n* **Intersection Types:** Create new types by combining the properties of existing types.\n* **Generics:** Define reusable functions and data structures that work with different types.\n* **Type Guards:**  Write functions that check the type of a value and return a boolean.\n* **Custom Types:** Define your own types using `type` or `interface` to enforce specific structures.\n\n**5. Example: Implementing a Simple Calculator**\n\n```typescript\n// Define custom types for operations and numbers\ntype Operation = 'add' | 'subtract' | 'multiply' | 'divide';\ntype Number = number;\n\n// Define a function to perform calculations\nconst calculate: (operation: Operation, a: Number, b: Number) => Number = (\n  operation,\n  a,\n  b\n) => {\n  switch (operation) {\n    case 'add':\n      return a + b;\n    case 'subtract':\n      return a - b;\n    case 'multiply':\n      return a * b;\n    case 'divide':\n      if (b === 0) {\n        throw new Error('Cannot divide by zero');\n      }\n      return a / b;\n    default:\n      throw new Error('Invalid operation');\n  }\n};\n\n// Example usage\nconst result = calculate('add', 5, 3);\nconsole.log(result); // Output: 8\n```\n\n**6. Tips for Rust Developers**\n\n* **Error Handling:**  Use exceptions or `Result` types for error handling, similar to Rust's `Result` enum.\n* **Immutability:** TypeScript's `const` keyword is similar to Rust's `let` with immutability.\n* **Data Structures:**  Immutability concepts are similar in both languages.\n* **Type Safety:** TypeScript's type system is less powerful than Rust's, but it still provides strong guarantees against type errors.\n\n**7. Resources and Libraries**\n\n* **fp-ts:** A comprehensive library for functional programming in TypeScript.\n* **Ramda:** A popular library for functional programming in JavaScript, also usable in TypeScript.\n* **TypeScript Documentation:**  [https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/)\n* **Functional Programming in JavaScript (FPJS):** [https://github.com/MostlyAdequate/mostly-adequate-guide](https://github.com/MostlyAdequate/mostly-adequate-guide)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy embracing functional programming principles and leveraging TypeScript's powerful type system, you can build robust, maintainable, and type-safe applications. This guide provides a solid foundation for Rust developers to start their journey with functional TypeScript. Remember to prioritize immutability, pure functions, and composition for a more predictable and enjoyable development experience.\n"

Functional Programming Concepts\n\n1. **Immutability**: Use `const` for constants and avoid mutating objects.\n2. **Pure Functions**: Functions should not have side effects.\n3. **Higher-Order Functions**: Functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions.\n4. **Function Composition**: Combine simple functions to build complex ones.\n5. **Monads and Functors**: Use libraries like fp-ts for advanced functional programming constructs.\n\n#### 4. Using `fp-ts` for Functional Programming\n\n`fp-ts` is a library for functional programming in TypeScript. It provides structures like `Option`, `Either`, `Task`, and more.\n\n1. **Install `fp-ts`**:\n    ```sh\n    npm install fp-ts\n    ```\n\n2. **Basic Usage**:\n    ```typescript\n    import { Option, some, none } from 'fp-ts/Option';\n\n    const getUserName = (user: User): Option<string> => {\n        return user.name ? some(user.name) : none;\n    };\n\n    const user: User = { id: 1, name: \"Alice\" };\n    const userName = getUserName(user);\n\n    userName.fold(\n        () => console.log('No name found'),\n        name => console.log(`User name is ${name}`)\n    );\n    ```\n\n3. **Using `Either` for Error Handling**:\n    ```typescript\n    import { Either, left, right } from 'fp-ts/Either';\n\n    const divide = (a: number, b: number): Either<string, number> => {\n        return b === 0 ? left('Cannot divide by zero') : right(a / b);\n    };\n\n    const result = divide(4, 2);\n\n    result.fold(\n        error => console.error(error),\n        value => console.log(`Result is ${value}`)\n    );\n    ```\n\n#### 5. Advanced Type Safety\n\n1. **Type Guards**: Narrow types using custom functions.\n    ```typescript\n    type Dog = { bark: () => void };\n    type Cat = { meow: () => void };\n\n    const isDog = (pet: Dog | Cat): pet is Dog => {\n        return (pet as Dog).bark !== undefined;\n    };\n    ```\n\n2. **Discriminated Unions**: Use a common property to distinguish between types.\n    ```typescript\n    type Shape = \n        | { kind: 'circle', radius: number }\n        | { kind: 'square', side: number };\n\n    const area = (shape: Shape): number => {\n        switch (shape.kind) {\n            case 'circle':\n                return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2;\n            case 'square':\n                return shape.side ** 2;\n        }\n    };\n    ```\n\n#### 6. Practical Tips for Rust Developers\n\n1. **Leverage TypeScript’s Type System**: Use interfaces, types, and enums to define strict types.\n2. **Use `readonly` for Immutability**: Define immutable properties.\n    ```typescript\n    type Point = {\n        readonly x: number;\n        readonly y: number;\n    };\n    ```\n3. **Functional Libraries**: Use libraries like `fp-ts`, `ramda`, or `lodash/fp` for functional programming utilities.\n4. **Avoid `any`**: Avoid using `any` type to maintain type safety.\n5. **Type Inference**: Trust TypeScript’s type inference but be explicit when necessary.\n6. **Use `strict` Mode**: Enable strict mode in `tsconfig.json` for maximum type safety.\n    ```json\n    {\n        \"compilerOptions\": {\n            \"strict\": true\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nTransitioning from Rust to TypeScript for functional programming can be smooth if you leverage TypeScript’s type system and functional programming libraries like `fp-ts`. By following the principles outlined in this guide, you can write type-safe, functional TypeScript code that feels familiar to your Rust programming experience."

    "res": "## Best Practices for Developing Applications in FP Style\n\nFunctional Programming (FP) emphasizes immutability, pure functions, and declarative programming. Here are some best practices for developing applications in FP style:\n\n**1. Immutability:**\n\n* **Avoid mutable state:** Instead of modifying existing data, create new data structures with the desired changes. This prevents unintended side effects and makes code easier to reason about.\n* **Use immutable data structures:** Languages like Haskell have built-in immutable data structures. In TypeScript, libraries like Immutable.js can be used.\n\n**Example:**\n\n**TypeScript (with Immutable.js):**\n\n```typescript\nimport { Map } from 'immutable';\n\nlet state = Map({ count: 0 });\nlet newState = state.set('count', state.get('count') + 1);\n\nconsole.log(state.get('count')); // 0\nconsole.log(newState.get('count')); // 1\n```\n\n**Haskell:**\n\n```haskell\nimport Data.Map (Map)\nimport qualified Data.Map as Map\n\nlet state = Map.fromList [(\"count\", 0)]\n    newState = Map.insert \"count\" (Map.findWithDefault 0 \"count\" state + 1) state\n\nprint $ Map.lookup \"count\" state -- Just 0\nprint $ Map.lookup \"count\" newState -- Just 1\n```\n\n**2. Pure Functions:**\n\n* **Functions should only depend on their input parameters:** This ensures consistent output for a given input, making functions easier to test and debug.\n* **Avoid side effects:** Side effects like modifying global variables or performing I/O should be handled separately.\n\n**Example:**\n\n**TypeScript:**\n\n```typescript\nfunction add(a: number, b: number): number {\n  return a + b; // Pure function: only depends on input, no side effects\n}\n```\n\n**Haskell:**\n\n```haskell\nadd :: Int -> Int -> Int\nadd a b = a + b -- Pure function\n```\n\n**3. Declarative Programming:**\n\n* **Focus on what you want to achieve, not how:** Describe the desired result instead of outlining step-by-step instructions.\n* **Use higher-order functions:** Functions like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` allow for concise and expressive data manipulation.\n\n**Example:**\n\n**TypeScript:**\n\n```typescript\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];\nconst evenNumbers = numbers.filter(n => n % 2 === 0); // Declarative: filter for even numbers\n\nconsole.log(evenNumbers); // [2, 4]\n```\n\n**Haskell:**\n\n```haskell\nlet numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n    evenNumbers = filter even numbers -- Declarative: filter for even numbers\n\nprint evenNumbers -- [2,4]\n```\n\n**4. Composition:**\n\n* **Build complex logic by combining smaller, reusable functions:** This promotes modularity and code reuse.\n* **Use function composition operators:** Languages like Haskell provide operators like `.` for composing functions.\n\n**Example:**\n\n**TypeScript:**\n\n```typescript\nconst addOne = (n: number) => n + 1;\nconst double = (n: number) => n * 2;\n\nconst addOneAndDouble = (n: number) => double(addOne(n)); // Function composition\n\nconsole.log(addOneAndDouble(5)); // 12\n```\n\n**Haskell:**\n\n```haskell\naddOne :: Int -> Int\naddOne n = n + 1\n\ndouble :: Int -> Int\ndouble n = n * 2\n\naddOneAndDouble :: Int -> Int\naddOneAndDouble = double . addOne -- Function composition using '.'\n\nprint $ addOneAndDouble 5 -- 12\n```\n\n**5. Error Handling:**\n\n* **Use algebraic data types (ADTs) to represent possible outcomes:** This allows for explicit error handling and avoids throwing exceptions.\n* **Utilize pattern matching to handle different cases:** This makes error handling more readable and robust.\n\n**Example:**\n\n**TypeScript (using discriminated unions):**\n\n```typescript\ntype Result<T> = { success: true, value: T } | { success: false, error: string };\n\nfunction divide(a: number, b: number): Result<number> {\n  if (b === 0) {\n    return { success: false, error: \"Cannot divide by zero\" };\n  } else {\n    return { success: true, value: a / b };\n  }\n}\n\nconst result = divide(10, 2);\n\nif (result.success) {\n  console.log(result.value); // 5\n} else {\n  console.log(result.error);\n}\n```\n\n**Haskell (using Maybe):**\n\n```haskell\nimport Data.Maybe\n\ndivide :: Int -> Int -> Maybe Int\ndivide a b\n  | b == 0 = Nothing\n  | otherwise = Just (a `div` b)\n\ncase divide 10 2 of\n  Just result -> print result -- 5\n  Nothing -> print \"Cannot divide by zero\"\n```\n\n**Sources:**\n\n* [Haskell Wiki: Functional Programming](https://wiki.haskell.org/Functional_programming)\n* [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/)\n* [Professor Frisby's Mostly Adequate Guide to Functional Programming](https://mostly-adequate.gitbook.io/mostly-adequate-guide/)\n* [Immutable.js Documentation](https://immutable-js.github.io/immutable-js/)\n\nThese are just some of the best practices for developing applications in FP style. The specific techniques and tools used will vary depending on the chosen language and project requirements. However, adhering to these principles can lead to more robust, maintainable, and scalable applications.\n"

Leverage Immutability:**\n\n* **Definition:** Data structures are immutable when their values cannot be changed after creation. Instead, new versions are created with the desired modifications.\n* **Benefits:**\n    * **Concurrency:** Immutable data structures are thread-safe as they don't need locks to protect against concurrent access.\n    * **Predictability:** Code becomes easier to reason about as the state of data is consistent.\n    * **Debugging:** Easier to track changes and identify the source of errors.\n* **Example:**\n\n**TypeScript:**\n\n```typescript\nconst user = { name: \"Alice\", age: 30 };\n\n// Immutable update:\nconst updatedUser = { ...user, age: 31 }; // Creates a new object with updated age\n\n// Original user remains unchanged\nconsole.log(user.age); // Output: 30\n```\n\n**Haskell:**\n\n```haskell\ndata User = User { name :: String, age :: Int }\n\nuser = User { name = \"Alice\", age = 30 }\n\n-- Immutable update:\nupdatedUser = user { age = 31 }\n\n-- Original user remains unchanged\nprint (age user) -- Output: 30\n```\n\n**3. Utilize Recursion:**\n\n* **Definition:** Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller, similar subproblems.\n* **Benefits:**\n    * **Elegance:** Recursion can often provide concise and elegant solutions.\n    * **Data Structures:** Well-suited for processing recursive data structures like trees and lists.\n    * **FP Style:** Recursion aligns well with the functional paradigm's emphasis on immutability and avoiding side effects.\n* **Example:**\n\n**TypeScript:**\n\n```typescript\nfunction factorial(n: number): number {\n  if (n === 0) {\n    return 1;\n  } else {\n    return n * factorial(n - 1);\n  }\n}\n\nconst result = factorial(5); // result will be 120\n```\n\n**Haskell:**\n\n```haskell\nfactorial :: Int -> Int\nfactorial 0 = 1\nfactorial n = n * factorial (n - 1)\n\nresult = factorial 5 -- result will be 120\n```\n\n**4. Employ Higher-Order Functions:**\n\n* **Definition:** Higher-order functions are functions that can take other functions as arguments or return functions as results.\n* **Benefits:**\n    * **Abstraction:** Higher-order functions allow you to abstract common patterns and reduce code duplication.\n    * **Flexibility:** They provide a powerful way to customize behavior without modifying the underlying code.\n    * **Composability:** Higher-order functions enable easy composition of functions to create complex logic.\n* **Example:**\n\n**TypeScript:**\n\n```typescript\nfunction map(arr: number[], fn: (n: number) => number): number[] {\n  return arr.map(fn);\n}\n\nconst doubled = map([1, 2, 3], (n) => n * 2); // doubled will be [2, 4, 6]\n```\n\n**Haskell:**\n\n```haskell\nmap :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]\nmap f [] = []\nmap f (x:xs) = f x : map f xs\n\ndoubled = map (* 2) [1, 2, 3] -- doubled will be [2, 4, 6]\n```\n\n**5. Consider Monads:**\n\n* **Definition:** Monads are a powerful concept in FP that provide a way to structure computations that involve side effects or complex data structures.\n* **Benefits:**\n    * **Error Handling:** Monads can be used to handle errors in a clean and composable way.\n    * **Asynchronous Operations:** They offer a way to manage asynchronous operations in a functional style.\n    * **Data Validation:** Monads can be used to enforce data validation rules.\n* **Example:**\n\n**TypeScript:**\n\n```typescript\nimport { Option } from \"fp-ts/lib/Option\";\n\nfunction findUser(id: number): Option<User> {\n  // ... logic to find user based on ID\n  if (userFound) {\n    return Option.some(userFound);\n  } else {\n    return Option.none;\n  }\n}\n\nconst user = findUser(123);\n\n// Handle the result using pattern matching\nswitch (user._tag) {\n  case \"Some\":\n    console.log(user.value.name);\n    break;\n  case \"None\":\n    console.log(\"User not found\");\n    break;\n}\n```\n\n**Haskell:**\n\n```haskell\nimport Control.Monad\n\ndata User = User { name :: String, age :: Int }\n\nfindUser :: Int -> Maybe User\nfindUser id =\n  -- ... logic to find user based on ID\n  if userFound then Just userFound else Nothing\n\nmain :: IO ()\nmain = do\n  user <- findUser 123\n\n  case user of\n    Just user -> print (name user)\n    Nothing -> putStrLn \"User not found\"\n```\n\n**6. Employ Function Composition:**\n\n* **Definition:** Function composition is a technique where you combine multiple functions to create a new function that performs a more complex operation.\n* **Benefits:**\n    * **Readability:** Composed functions are easier to read and understand than a single complex function.\n    * **Reusability:** Composed functions can be reused in different parts of the application.\n    * **Testability:** Each function in the composition can be tested independently.\n* **Example:**\n\n**TypeScript:**\n\n```typescript\nconst greet = (name: string) => `Hello, ${name}!`;\nconst toUpper = (str: string) => str.toUpperCase();\n\nconst greetUpper = compose(greet, toUpper);\n\nconst result = greetUpper(\"Alice\"); // result will be \"HELLO, ALICE!\"\n```\n\n**Haskell:**\n\n```haskell\ngreet :: String -> String\ngreet name = \"Hello, \" ++ name ++ \"!\"\n\ntoUpper :: String -> String\ntoUpper str = map toUpper str\n\ngreetUpper :: String -> String\ngreetUpper = greet . toUpper\n\nresult = greetUpper \"Alice\" -- result will be \"HELLO, ALICE!\"\n```\n\n**7. Utilize Libraries and Frameworks:**\n\n* **Definition:** Several FP-oriented libraries and frameworks are available for different programming languages.\n* **Benefits:**\n    * **Productivity:** Libraries and frameworks provide ready-made solutions for common FP tasks, saving development time.\n    * **Best Practices:** They often embody best practices and patterns for functional programming.\n    * **Community Support:** Access to a community of developers who can provide support and guidance.\n* **Example:**\n\n* **TypeScript:**\n    * **fp-ts:** A library offering a comprehensive set of functional programming tools.\n    * **ramda:** A library providing a wide range of higher-order functions and utilities.\n* **Haskell:**\n    * **lens:** A library for working with data structures in a functional way.\n    * **mtl:** A library that provides a framework for monadic programming.\n\n**8. Prioritize Testability:**\n\n* **Definition:** FP code is inherently more testable due to the use of pure functions and immutability.\n* **Benefits:**\n    * **Confidence:** Thorough testing ensures the correctness and reliability of the code.\n    * **Regression Prevention:** Tests help prevent regressions when making changes to the code.\n    * **Documentation:** Tests can serve as documentation of the code's behavior.\n* **Example:**\n\n**TypeScript:**\n\n```typescript\nimport { add } from \"./math\";\n\ndescribe(\"add\", () => {\n  it(\"should add two numbers\", () => {\n    expect(add(2, 3)).toBe(5);\n  });\n});\n```\n\n**Haskell:**\n\n```haskell\nimport Test.Hspec\n\nadd :: Int -> Int -> Int\nadd a b = a + b\n\nmain :: IO ()\nmain = hspec $ do\n  describe \"add\" $ do\n    it \"should add two numbers\" $ do\n      add 2 3 `shouldBe` 5\n```\n\n**9. Embrace Code Clarity:**\n\n* **Definition:** FP code tends to be concise and easier to understand due to the use of pure functions, immutability, and higher-order functions.\n* **Benefits:**\n    * **Maintainability:** Clear code is easier to maintain and modify over time.\n    * **Collaboration:** Easier for multiple developers to work on the same codebase.\n    * **Debugging:** Easier to identify and fix bugs in clear code.\n* **Example:**\n\n**TypeScript:**\n\n```typescript\nconst filterEvenNumbers = (numbers: number[]): number[] => {\n  return numbers.filter((number) => number % 2 === 0);\n};\n```\n\n**Haskell:**\n\n```haskell\nfilterEvenNumbers :: [Int] -> [Int]\nfilterEvenNumbers numbers = filter even numbers\n```\n\n**10. Remember to Adapt:**\n\n* **Definition:** It's essential to adapt FP principles to the specific needs of your project and choose the appropriate tools and techniques.\n* **Benefits:**\n    * **Pragmatism:** FP can be applied selectively to specific parts of an application where it offers the most benefit.\n    * **Flexibility:** FP is not a rigid dogma and can be adapted to different programming paradigms and contexts.\n    * **Performance:** FP can sometimes lead to performance issues, especially when dealing with side effects. It's important to consider these trade-offs and optimize code accordingly.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n* [Functional Programming in JavaScript](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/functional-programming-in-javascript/)\n* [Haskell Wiki](https://wiki.haskell.org/Functional_programming)\n* [Functional Programming for Beginners](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/functional-programming-for-beginners/)\n* [The Little Schemer](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/little-schemer-fourth-edition)\n* [Thinking Functionally](https://www.manning.com/books/thinking-functionally)\n\nThis information provides a starting point for understanding best practices in functional programming.
