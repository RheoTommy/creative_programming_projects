            "response": "Functional Programming (FP) is a programming paradigm that emphasizes the use of pure functions, immutability, and declarative programming. Unlike imperative programming, which focuses on how to perform tasks, FP focuses on what to perform. Here are the main principles and concepts of FP:

1. **Immutability**: In FP, data is immutable, meaning it cannot be changed once created. This leads to more predictable and thread-safe code.

2. **Pure Functions**: Functions in FP are pure, meaning they always produce the same output for the same input and have no side effects. This makes them easier to test and reason about.

3. **Declarative Programming**: FP promotes a declarative style of programming where you describe what you want to achieve rather than how to achieve it. This contrasts with the imperative style, which involves explicit step-by-step instructions.

4. **Higher-Order Functions**: These are functions that can take other functions as arguments or return functions as results. They enable more modular and reusable code.

5. **Contrast with Other Paradigms**: FP is often contrasted with imperative programming and object-oriented programming (OOP). While imperative programming focuses on changing program state through statements, FP avoids changing state and mutable data. OOP, on the other hand, organizes code around objects and their interactions, whereas FP focuses on functions and their compositions.

6. **Popular Functional Programming Languages**: Some popular languages that support or are designed for functional programming include Scala, Kotlin, and Clojure. These languages offer features and capabilities that facilitate functional programming.

Overall, Functional Programming aims to create more predictable, modular, and maintainable code by adhering to these principles."
