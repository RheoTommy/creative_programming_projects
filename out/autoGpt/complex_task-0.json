Based on the search results, the most relevant links appear to be the official Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2023 page and the blog post summarizing the survey results. I will visit both these pages to find the top 5 most liked programming languages.

The official Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2023 page did not provide a direct list of the top 5 most liked programming languages. I will now visit the blog post summarizing the survey results, as it is likely to contain the specific information I am looking for.

The blog post did not provide a direct list of the top 5 most liked programming languages either. However, there is a link to the "2023 Developer Survey Results Microsite," which is likely to contain the detailed survey results, including the top programming languages.

I will visit the "2023 Developer Survey Results Microsite" to find the specific information about the top 5 most liked programming languages.
