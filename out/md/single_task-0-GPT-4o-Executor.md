### Best Practices for Developing an Application in Functional Programming Style

Functional programming (FP) emphasizes the evaluation of expressions rather than the execution of commands. Here are some best practices for developing an application in FP style:

1. **Immutability**: Avoid changing state or mutable data. Instead, use immutable data structures and return new copies of data when changes are needed.
2. **Pure Functions**: Ensure functions are pure, meaning they don't have side effects and return the same output for the same input.
3. **First-Class and Higher-Order Functions**: Treat functions as first-class citizens by passing them as arguments, returning them from other functions, and using higher-order functions to create more abstract, reusable code.
4. **Function Composition**: Combine simple functions to build more complex functions, enhancing modularity and readability.
5. **Declarative Code**: Write code that describes what to do rather than how to do it, making use of expressions and avoiding imperative constructs.
6. **Recursion Over Looping**: Use recursion instead of loops for iteration, as it aligns better with the FP paradigm.
7. **Lazy Evaluation**: Evaluate expressions only when their values are needed, which can improve performance and work with infinite data structures.
8. **Type Safety**: Use strong, static types to catch errors at compile time. This is especially beneficial in languages like Haskell and TypeScript.

### TypeScript Examples for Functional Programming

Here's a simple example of functional programming in TypeScript:

```typescript
// Pure function
const add = (a: number, b: number): number => a + b;

// Higher-order function
const applyOperation = (x: number, y: number, operation: (a: number, b: number) => number): number => {
    return operation(x, y);
};

// Using the higher-order function
const result = applyOperation(5, 3, add);
console.log(result); // 8

// Immutability example
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const newNumbers = numbers.map(n => n * 2);
console.log(newNumbers); // [2, 4, 6]
```

### Haskell Examples for Functional Programming

Here's a simple example of functional programming in Haskell:

```haskell
-- Pure function
add :: Int -> Int -> Int
add a b = a + b

-- Higher-order function
applyOperation :: (Int -> Int -> Int) -> Int -> Int -> Int
applyOperation operation x y = operation x y

-- Using the higher-order function
main :: IO ()
main = do
    let result = applyOperation add 5 3
    print result -- 8

-- Immutability example
doubleNumbers :: [Int] -> [Int]
doubleNumbers numbers = map (*2) numbers

main2 :: IO ()
main2 = do
    let numbers = [1, 2, 3]
    let newNumbers = doubleNumbers numbers
    print newNumbers -- [2, 4, 6]
```
