### Best Practices for Developing an Application in Functional Programming (FP) Style

Functional Programming (FP) is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data. Here are some best practices for developing an application in FP style:

1. **Immutability**:
   - Use immutable data structures.
   - Avoid changing state or mutable data to ensure predictability and easier debugging.

2. **Pure Functions**:
   - Ensure that functions have no side effects and return the same output for the same input.
   - Pure functions make your code more predictable and easier to test.

3. **First-Class and Higher-Order Functions**:
   - Treat functions as first-class citizens: pass them as arguments, return them from other functions, and assign them to variables.
   - Use higher-order functions to abstract common patterns of computation.

4. **Function Composition**:
   - Build complex operations by combining simpler functions.
   - Use function composition to create pipelines of operations.

5. **Declarative Code**:
   - Focus on what to solve rather than how to solve it.
   - Use expressions instead of statements wherever possible.

6. **Referential Transparency**:
   - Ensure that expressions can be replaced with their corresponding values without changing the program's behavior.
   - This property makes reasoning about code easier.

7. **Recursion**:
   - Use recursion instead of loops for iteration.
   - Tail recursion optimization can help prevent stack overflow issues.

8. **Currying and Partial Application**:
   - Use currying to transform functions that take multiple arguments into a series of functions that each take a single argument.
   - Apply partial application to fix a few arguments of a function and generate a new function.

9. **Monad and Functors**:
   - Use monads and functors for handling side effects such as IO, state, or asynchronous operations.
   - They help in maintaining functional purity while dealing with side effects.

### Examples of Functional Programming in TypeScript and Haskell

#### TypeScript Example

```typescript
// Pure function
const add = (a: number, b: number): number => a + b;

// Higher-order function
const map = <T, U>(fn: (x: T) => U, arr: T[]): U[] => arr.map(fn);

// Function composition
const compose = <T>(...fns: ((x: T) => T)[]): (x: T) => T =>
  fns.reduce((f, g) => x => f(g(x)));

// Currying
const multiply = (a: number) => (b: number): number => a * b;

// Example usage
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const doubled = map(multiply(2), numbers);  // [2, 4, 6]
console.log(doubled);
```

#### Haskell Example

```haskell
-- Pure function
add :: Int -> Int -> Int
add a b = a + b

-- Higher-order function
map' :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
map' _ [] = []
map' f (x:xs) = f x : map' f xs

-- Function composition
compose :: [(a -> a)] -> (a -> a)
compose = foldr (.) id

-- Currying
multiply :: Int -> (Int -> Int)
multiply a b = a * b

-- Example usage
main :: IO ()
main = do
  let numbers = [1, 2, 3]
  let doubled = map' (multiply 2) numbers  -- [2, 4, 6]
  print doubled
```
