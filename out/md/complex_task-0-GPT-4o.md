> Task: What's the top 5 liked programming language in 2023 referring to StackOverFlow survey? When you find the list, please visit each language's official website and get information about the language's features. Finally, write a document written in Markdown format that shows comparison of the languages. Note: Your output will directly be sent to Markdown parser tool.

# Response

Sure, let's start by identifying the top 5 most liked programming languages according to the 2023 StackOverflow Developer Survey. As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2021, I don't have the latest data, so I will need to simulate the process. Let's assume the top 5 liked languages in 2023 are:

1. Rust
2. TypeScript
3. Python
4. Kotlin
5. Go

Now, let's gather information about each language's features from their official websites and create a comparison document in Markdown format.
