## Building TypeScript Applications with Functional Programming: A Guide for Rust Developers

This guide aims to help Rust developers transition to TypeScript development with a functional programming (FP) approach. We'll focus on leveraging TypeScript's strong type system for safe and predictable code.

**1. Understanding the Key Concepts**

* **Immutability:**  Just like in Rust, strive to make data immutable by default. This prevents accidental modifications and promotes predictable behavior. 
* **Pure Functions:** Functions should always produce the same output for the same input, without side effects. This makes code easier to reason about and test.
* **Composition:** Build complex logic by composing smaller, reusable functions. This enhances code modularity and maintainability.
* **Data Structures:** Utilize immutable data structures like tuples, arrays, and objects, along with higher-order functions to manipulate them.
* **Types:** TypeScript's type system provides static guarantees for data types, ensuring type safety throughout your application.

**2. Setting Up Your Project**

* **Create a new project:** Use `npm init -y` or `yarn init -y` to initialize a new project.
* **Install TypeScript:**  Install the TypeScript compiler globally: `npm install -g typescript`.
* **Configure tsconfig.json:** Create a `tsconfig.json` file with the following settings:
  ```json
  {
    "compilerOptions": {
      "target": "es5",
      "module": "commonjs",
      "strict": true,
      "noImplicitAny": true,
      "noImplicitThis": true,
      "noUnusedLocals": true,
      "noUnusedParameters": true,
      "esModuleInterop": true,
      "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
      "outDir": "dist",
      "sourceMap": true
    }
  }
  ```
  These settings enforce strict type checking, eliminate implicit types, and ensure your code is well-structured.

**3. Embracing Functional Programming**

* **Immutable Data:** Use `const` for variables to ensure immutability. For objects, use `Object.freeze()` to prevent modifications.
* **Pure Functions:** Define functions that take arguments and return a value without side effects.
* **Higher-Order Functions:** Utilize functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions. Common examples include `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, and `compose`.
* **Data Structures:** Leverage immutable data structures like `ReadonlyArray` for arrays and `Readonly<T>` for objects.

**4. Leveraging TypeScript's Type System**

* **Type Inference:** TypeScript often infers types automatically, reducing the need for explicit type annotations.
* **Union Types:**  Combine multiple types to represent a value that can be one of them.
* **Intersection Types:** Create new types by combining the properties of existing types.
* **Generics:** Define reusable functions and data structures that work with different types.
* **Type Guards:**  Write functions that check the type of a value and return a boolean.
* **Custom Types:** Define your own types using `type` or `interface` to enforce specific structures.

**5. Example: Implementing a Simple Calculator**

```typescript
// Define custom types for operations and numbers
type Operation = 'add' | 'subtract' | 'multiply' | 'divide';
type Number = number;

// Define a function to perform calculations
const calculate: (operation: Operation, a: Number, b: Number) => Number = (
  operation,
  a,
  b
) => {
  switch (operation) {
    case 'add':
      return a + b;
    case 'subtract':
      return a - b;
    case 'multiply':
      return a * b;
    case 'divide':
      if (b === 0) {
        throw new Error('Cannot divide by zero');
      }
      return a / b;
    default:
      throw new Error('Invalid operation');
  }
};

// Example usage
const result = calculate('add', 5, 3);
console.log(result); // Output: 8
```

**6. Tips for Rust Developers**

* **Error Handling:**  Use exceptions or `Result` types for error handling, similar to Rust's `Result` enum.
* **Immutability:** TypeScript's `const` keyword is similar to Rust's `let` with immutability.
* **Data Structures:**  Immutability concepts are similar in both languages.
* **Type Safety:** TypeScript's type system is less powerful than Rust's, but it still provides strong guarantees against type errors.

**7. Resources and Libraries**

* **fp-ts:** A comprehensive library for functional programming in TypeScript.
* **Ramda:** A popular library for functional programming in JavaScript, also usable in TypeScript.
* **TypeScript Documentation:**  [https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/)
* **Functional Programming in JavaScript (FPJS):** [https://github.com/MostlyAdequate/mostly-adequate-guide](https://github.com/MostlyAdequate/mostly-adequate-guide)

**Conclusion**

By embracing functional programming principles and leveraging TypeScript's powerful type system, you can build robust, maintainable, and type-safe applications. This guide provides a solid foundation for Rust developers to start their journey with functional TypeScript. Remember to prioritize immutability, pure functions, and composition for a more predictable and enjoyable development experience.
