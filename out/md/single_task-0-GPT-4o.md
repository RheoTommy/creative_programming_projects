# Response

Developing an application in a functional programming (FP) style can lead to more predictable, maintainable, and testable code. Here are some best practices for developing an application in FP style, along with examples in TypeScript and Haskell.

### Best Practices for FP Development

1. **Immutability**: Avoid changing state and data after they are created. Instead, create new instances with the updated values.

2. **Pure Functions**: Ensure functions have no side effects and always produce the same output for the same input.

3. **First-Class Functions**: Treat functions as first-class citizens, meaning they can be passed as arguments, returned from other functions, and assigned to variables.

4. **Higher-Order Functions**: Use functions that take other functions as arguments or return them as results.

5. **Function Composition**: Build complex functions by combining simpler ones.

6. **Declarative Code**: Focus on what the program should accomplish rather than how to accomplish it.

7. **Type Safety**: Utilize strong type systems to catch errors at compile-time.

8. **Monads and Functors**: Use these abstractions to handle side effects like I/O, state, and exceptions in a controlled manner.

### TypeScript Example

TypeScript supports functional programming principles and can be used to write FP-style code.

```typescript
// Utility functions
const add = (a: number) => (b: number): number => a + b;
const multiply = (a: number) => (b: number): number => a * b;

// Higher-order function
const applyOperation = (operation: (a: number) => (b: number) => number, x: number, y: number): number => {
    return operation(x)(y);
}

// Immutable data
const numbers: ReadonlyArray<number> = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Using map and reduce
const sum = numbers.reduce(applyOperation(add), 0);
const product = numbers.reduce(applyOperation(multiply), 1);

console.log(`Sum: ${sum}`); // Sum: 15
console.log(`Product: ${product}`); // Product: 120
```

### Haskell Example

Haskell is a purely functional programming language, making it ideal for demonstrating FP principles.

```haskell
-- Pure function
add :: Int -> Int -> Int
add x y = x + y

-- Higher-order function
applyOperation :: (Int -> Int -> Int) -> Int -> Int -> Int
applyOperation operation x y = operation x y

-- Immutable list
numbers :: [Int]
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

-- Using foldr (right fold)
sum :: Int
sum = foldr (applyOperation add) 0 numbers

-- Using foldl (left fold)
product :: Int
product = foldl (*) 1 numbers

main :: IO ()
main = do
    putStrLn $ "Sum: " ++ show sum        -- Sum: 15
    putStrLn $ "Product: " ++ show product -- Product: 120
```
