# Response

Functional programming (FP) promotes a declarative coding style that emphasizes immutability, first-class functions, and pure functions. Here are some best practices for developing an application in FP style, along with examples in TypeScript and Haskell.

### Best Practices for Developing an Application in FP Style

1. **Immutability**: Avoid mutable state. Use immutable data structures and ensure that data does not change once created.
   
2. **Pure Functions**: Write functions that return the same output for the same input and have no side effects.

3. **First-Class Functions**: Treat functions as first-class citizens. Pass them as arguments, return them from other functions, and assign them to variables.

4. **Higher-Order Functions**: Use functions that take other functions as arguments or return them as results.

5. **Function Composition**: Combine simple functions to build more complex ones. This helps in reusability and maintainability.

6. **Declarative Code**: Focus on what to do rather than how to do it. Use expressions instead of statements.

7. **Type Safety**: Use strong typing to catch errors at compile time. Languages like Haskell and TypeScript are good for this.

8. **Recursion**: Prefer recursion over iterative loops. Use tail recursion to optimize performance.

9. **Monads and Functors**: Learn and use monads and functors to handle side effects and data transformations.

10. **Pattern Matching**: Use pattern matching to deconstruct data structures and handle different cases cleanly.

### TypeScript Example

TypeScript supports FP through its type system and functional features. Hereâ€™s an example demonstrating some of the best practices:

```typescript
// TypeScript Example

// Immutability
const add = (a: number, b: number): number => a + b;

// Pure Function
const multiply = (a: number, b: number): number => a * b;

// Higher-Order Function
const applyOperation = (a: number, b: number, operation: (x: number, y: number) => number): number => {
    return operation(a, b);
};

// Function Composition
const compose = <T, U, V>(f: (x: U) => V, g: (x: T) => U) => (x: T): V => f(g(x));

// Example usage
const addThenMultiply = compose((x: number) => multiply(x, 2), (x: number) => add(x, 3));

console.log(addThenMultiply(5)); // Output: 16
```

### Haskell Example

Haskell is a purely functional language, making it ideal for demonstrating FP concepts:

```haskell
-- Haskell Example

-- Immutability and Pure Function
add :: Int -> Int -> Int
add a b = a + b

-- Higher-Order Function
applyOperation :: (Int -> Int -> Int) -> Int -> Int -> Int
applyOperation operation a b = operation a b

-- Function Composition
compose :: (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> a -> c
compose f g x = f (g x)

-- Example usage
addThenMultiply :: Int -> Int
addThenMultiply = compose (* 2) (+ 3)

main :: IO ()
main = print (addThenMultiply 5)  -- Output: 16
```

These best practices and examples should help guide you in developing applications using the functional programming paradigm in both TypeScript and Haskell.
