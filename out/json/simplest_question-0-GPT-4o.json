  "res": "Functional programming (FP) is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data. It emphasizes the application of functions, in contrast to the imperative programming paradigm, which emphasizes changes in state and the execution of sequential commands.\n\nHere are some key concepts and characteristics of functional programming:\n\n1. **First-Class and Higher-Order Functions**: Functions are treated as first-class citizens, meaning they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned as values from other functions. Higher-order functions are functions that can take other functions as arguments or return them as results.\n\n2. **Pure Functions**: A pure function is a function where the output value is determined only by its input values, without observable side effects. This means that it consistently yields the same result given the same input and does not alter any state or data outside its scope.\n\n3. **Immutability**: In functional programming, data is immutable, meaning once it is created, it cannot be changed. Instead of modifying existing data, new data structures are created. This helps to avoid side effects and makes the code easier to reason about.\n\n4. **Function Composition**: Functions can be composed to build more complex functions. Function composition involves combining two or more functions to produce a new function, where the output of one function becomes the input of another.\n\n5. **Recursion**: Functional programming often relies on recursion as a primary mechanism for looping, rather than iterative constructs like loops found in imperative languages. Recursive functions call themselves with modified parameters until a base condition is met.\n\n6. **Declarative Approach**: Functional programming is declarative rather than imperative. It focuses on what to solve rather than how to solve it. This means you describe the desired results, and the language takes care of the details about how to achieve those results.\n\n7. **Referential Transparency**: An expression is referentially transparent if it can be replaced with its value without changing the program's behavior. This property makes reasoning about and refactoring code easier, as functions can be understood in isolation.\n\n8. **Lazy Evaluation**: Some functional languages support lazy evaluation, meaning expressions are not evaluated until their values are needed. This can improve performance by avoiding unnecessary calculations and can enable the definition of potentially infinite data structures.\n\nPopular functional programming languages include Haskell, Lisp, Erlang, and Scala, though many modern programming languages like JavaScript, Python, and Java have adopted functional programming features.\n\nFunctional programming can lead to more predictable and maintainable code, especially in concurrent and parallel programming scenarios, by minimizing side effects and making it easier to reason about program behavior."
