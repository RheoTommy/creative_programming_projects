Here are some best practices for developing an application in FP style, along with examples in TypeScript and Haskell.\n\n### Best Practices for Developing an Application in FP Style\n\n1. **Immutability**: Avoid mutable state. Use immutable data structures and ensure that data does not change once created.\n   \n2. **Pure Functions**: Write functions that return the same output for the same input and have no side effects.\n\n3. **First-Class Functions**: Treat functions as first-class citizens. Pass them as arguments, return them from other functions, and assign them to variables.\n\n4. **Higher-Order Functions**: Use functions that take other functions as arguments or return them as results.\n\n5. **Function Composition**: Combine simple functions to build more complex ones. This helps in reusability and maintainability.\n\n6. **Declarative Code**: Focus on what to do rather than how to do it. Use expressions instead of statements.\n\n7. **Type Safety**: Use strong typing to catch errors at compile time. Languages like Haskell and TypeScript are good for this.\n\n8. **Recursion**: Prefer recursion over iterative loops. Use tail recursion to optimize performance.\n\n9. **Monads and Functors**: Learn and use monads and functors to handle side effects and data transformations.\n\n10. **Pattern Matching**: Use pattern matching to deconstruct data structures and handle different cases cleanly.\n\n### TypeScript Example\n\nTypeScript supports FP through its type system and functional features. Hereâ€™s an example demonstrating some of the best practices:\n\n```typescript\n// TypeScript Example\n\n// Immutability\nconst add = (a: number, b: number): number => a + b;\n\n// Pure Function\nconst multiply = (a: number, b: number): number => a * b;\n\n// Higher-Order Function\nconst applyOperation = (a: number, b: number, operation: (x: number, y: number) => number): number => {\n    return operation(a, b);\n};\n\n// Function Composition\nconst compose = <T, U, V>(f: (x: U) => V, g: (x: T) => U) => (x: T): V => f(g(x));\n\n// Example usage\nconst addThenMultiply = compose((x: number) => multiply(x, 2), (x: number) => add(x, 3));\n\nconsole.log(addThenMultiply(5)); // Output: 16\n```\n\n### Haskell Example\n\nHaskell is a purely functional language, making it ideal for demonstrating FP concepts:\n\n```haskell\n-- Haskell Example\n\n-- Immutability and Pure Function\nadd :: Int -> Int -> Int\nadd a b = a + b\n\n-- Higher-Order Function\napplyOperation :: (Int -> Int -> Int) -> Int -> Int -> Int\napplyOperation operation a b = operation a b\n\n-- Function Composition\ncompose :: (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> a -> c\ncompose f g x = f (g x)\n\n-- Example usage\naddThenMultiply :: Int -> Int\naddThenMultiply = compose (* 2) (+ 3)\n\nmain :: IO ()\nmain = print (addThenMultiply 5)  -- Output: 16\n```\n\n### References\n\n1. **Hutton, G.
