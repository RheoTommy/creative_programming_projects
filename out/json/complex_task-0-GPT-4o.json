Rust\n\n- **Website**: [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)\n- **Features**:\n  - **Memory Safety**: Guarantees memory safety without a garbage collector.\n  - **Concurrency**: Strong support for concurrent programming.\n  - **Performance**: Comparable to C and C++ in terms of performance.\n  - **Ownership System**: Ensures memory safety and prevents data races.\n  - **Tooling**: Excellent tooling including Cargo (package manager) and Rustfmt (code formatter).\n\n## 2. TypeScript\n\n- **Website**: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)\n- **Features**:\n  - **Static Typing**: Adds optional static types to JavaScript.\n  - **Compatibility**: Fully compatible with JavaScript.\n  - **Tooling**: Strong support in modern editors, with powerful autocompletion and refactoring tools.\n  - **Type Inference**: Automatically infers types to make code more robust.\n  - **OOP Support**: Supports object-oriented programming including interfaces and inheritance.\n\n## 3. Python\n\n- **Website**: [Python](https://www.python.org/)\n- **Features**:\n  - **Ease of Learning**: Simple and easy-to-read syntax.\n  - **Libraries and Frameworks**: Extensive standard library and a vast ecosystem of third-party packages.\n  - **Interpreted Language**: Runs directly from the source code, facilitating rapid development.\n  - **Cross-Platform**: Runs on various platforms including Windows, macOS, and Linux.\n  - **Versatility**: Used in web development, data science, AI, machine learning, and more.\n\n## 4. Kotlin\n\n- **Website**: [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)\n- **Features**:\n  - **Interoperability**: Fully interoperable with Java.\n  - **Null Safety**: Built-in null safety to eliminate NullPointerExceptions.\n  - **Concise Syntax**: Reduces boilerplate code compared to Java.\n  - **Coroutines**: Simplifies asynchronous programming.\n  - **Cross-Platform**: Supports JVM, Android, JavaScript, and native platforms.\n\n## 5. Go (Golang)\n\n- **Website**: [Go](https://golang.org/)\n- **Features**:\n  - **Simplicity**: Simple and clean syntax.\n  - **Concurrency**: Goroutines and channels for easy concurrent programming.\n  - **Performance**: Compiles to native code, offering performance close to C/C++.\n  - **Standard Library**: Rich standard library with built-in support for web servers, cryptography, and more.\n  - **Garbage Collection**: Automatic memory management.\n\n## Summary\n\n| Feature             | Rust                                     | TypeScript                                | Python                                    | Kotlin                                    | Go                                        |\n|---------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Memory Safety       | Yes                                      | No                                        | No                                        | No                                        | Yes                                       |\n| Static Typing       | Yes                                      | Yes                                       | No (Optional with type hints)             | Yes                                       | No                                        |\n| Concurrency         | Yes                                      | No                                        | No (with threading and asyncio)           | Yes                                       | Yes                                       |\n| Performance         | High                                     | Medium                                    | Medium                                    | High                                      | High                                      |\n| Ease of Learning    | Medium                                   | Medium                                    | High                                      | Medium                                    | High                                      |\n| Cross-Platform      | Yes                                      | Yes                                       | Yes                                       | Yes                                       | Yes                                       |\n| Null Safety         | Yes                                      | No                                        | No                                        | Yes                                       | No                                        |\n| Standard Library    | Good                                     | Moderate                                  | Extensive                                 | Moderate                                  | Rich                                      |\n| Ecosystem           | Growing                                  | Large                                     | Vast                                      | Growing                                   | Growing                                   |\n\nThis comparison highlights the strengths and unique features of each language, helping developers choose the right tool for their specific needs."
