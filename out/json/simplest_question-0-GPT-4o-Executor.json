  "res": "Functional Programming (FP) is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state or mutable data. Here are some key concepts and principles of Functional Programming:\n\n1. **First-Class and Higher-Order Functions**: Functions are first-class citizens in FP, meaning they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions. Higher-order functions are those that can take other functions as arguments or return them as results.\n\n2. **Pure Functions**: A pure function is one that, given the same input, will always produce the same output and has no side effects (e.g., modifying a global variable or changing the state of the system).\n\n3. **Immutability**: Data is immutable in FP, meaning once a data structure is created, it cannot be changed. Instead, new data structures are created by copying and modifying existing ones.\n\n4. **Function Composition**: Functions can be composed together to build more complex operations. Function composition is the process of combining two or more functions to produce a new function.\n\n5. **Declarative Code**: FP emphasizes writing declarative code, where the focus is on what to do rather than how to do it. This contrasts with imperative programming, where the focus is on describing the steps to achieve a result.\n\n6. **Recursion**: FP often uses recursion as a primary mechanism for looping, instead of traditional loops like `for` or `while`.\n\n7. **Referential Transparency**: An expression is referentially transparent if it can be replaced with its value without changing the program's behavior. This property is a direct consequence of using pure functions.\n\n8. **Lazy Evaluation**: Some functional languages use lazy evaluation, meaning expressions are not evaluated until their values are needed. This can improve performance by avoiding unnecessary calculations.\n\nPopular functional programming languages include Haskell, Lisp, Erlang, and Scala, but many modern languages like JavaScript, Python, and Java have adopted functional programming features."
