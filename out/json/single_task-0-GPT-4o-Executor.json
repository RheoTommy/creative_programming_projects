Here are some best practices for developing an application in FP style:\n\n1. **Immutability**: Avoid changing state or mutable data. Instead, use immutable data structures and return new copies of data when changes are needed.\n2. **Pure Functions**: Ensure functions are pure, meaning they don't have side effects and return the same output for the same input.\n3. **First-Class and Higher-Order Functions**: Treat functions as first-class citizens by passing them as arguments, returning them from other functions, and using higher-order functions to create more abstract, reusable code.\n4. **Function Composition**: Combine simple functions to build more complex functions, enhancing modularity and readability.\n5. **Declarative Code**: Write code that describes what to do rather than how to do it, making use of expressions and avoiding imperative constructs.\n6. **Recursion Over Looping**: Use recursion instead of loops for iteration, as it aligns better with the FP paradigm.\n7. **Lazy Evaluation**: Evaluate expressions only when their values are needed, which can improve performance and work with infinite data structures.\n8. **Type Safety**: Use strong, static types to catch errors at compile time. This is especially beneficial in languages like Haskell and TypeScript.\n\n### TypeScript Examples for Functional Programming\n\nHere's a simple example of functional programming in TypeScript:\n\n```typescript\n// Pure function\nconst add = (a: number, b: number): number => a + b;\n\n// Higher-order function\nconst applyOperation = (x: number, y: number, operation: (a: number, b: number) => number): number => {\n    return operation(x, y);\n};\n\n// Using the higher-order function\nconst result = applyOperation(5, 3, add);\nconsole.log(result); // 8\n\n// Immutability example\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 3];\nconst newNumbers = numbers.map(n => n * 2);\nconsole.log(newNumbers); // [2, 4, 6]\n```\n\n### Haskell Examples for Functional Programming\n\nHere's a simple example of functional programming in Haskell:\n\n```haskell\n-- Pure function\nadd :: Int -> Int -> Int\nadd a b = a + b\n\n-- Higher-order function\napplyOperation :: (Int -> Int -> Int) -> Int -> Int -> Int\napplyOperation operation x y = operation x y\n\n-- Using the higher-order function\nmain :: IO ()\nmain = do\n    let result = applyOperation add 5 3\n    print result -- 8\n\n-- Immutability example\ndoubleNumbers :: [Int] -> [Int]\ndoubleNumbers numbers = map (*2) numbers\n\nmain2 :: IO ()\nmain2 = do\n    let numbers = [1, 2, 3]\n    let newNumbers = doubleNumbers numbers\n    print newNumbers -- [2, 4, 6]\n```\n\n### Sources\n\n1.
