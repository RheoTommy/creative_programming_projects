Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. It emphasizes the application of functions, in contrast to the imperative programming paradigm, which emphasizes changes in state and the execution of sequences of commands.

Here are some key concepts and characteristics of functional programming:

1. **First-class and Higher-order Functions**: Functions are treated as first-class citizens, meaning they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions. Higher-order functions are functions that take other functions as arguments or return them as results.

2. **Pure Functions**: A function is called pure if it always returns the same result given the same arguments (it is deterministic) and does not cause any observable side effects (like modifying a global object or a parameter passed by reference).

3. **Immutability**: In functional programming, once data is created, it cannot be changed. Any modification produces a new data structure. This leads to safer and more predictable code.

4. **Function Composition**: Functions can be composed together to build more complex operations. The output of one function becomes the input to another.

5. **Recursion**: Functional programming often uses recursive methods for repeating operations, instead of traditional looping techniques used in imperative programming.

6. **Declarative Nature**: Functional programming is more about describing what to solve rather than how to solve it (which is more common in imperative styles). This can make the code more concise and easier to reason about.

7. **Lazy Evaluation**: Functional languages can also use lazy evaluation, where computations are delayed until their results are needed. This can help in performance improvements and handling of infinite data structures.

Languages that support functional programming either primarily or as a significant capability include Haskell, Lisp, Scala, Erlang, Clojure, and F#. Other languages like JavaScript, Python, and Ruby support functional programming but are not primarily functional languages.

Functional programming can lead to code that is easier to test, understand, and debug, making it a valuable paradigm especially in complex systems that require high reliability and maintainability.
