## Best Practices for Developing Applications in FP Style

Functional programming (FP) emphasizes immutability, pure functions, and declarative programming paradigms. Here are some best practices for developing applications in FP style:

**1. Immutability:**

* **Avoid mutable state:**  Changes in state can lead to unpredictable behavior and make debugging difficult. 
* **Use immutable data structures:** Libraries like Immutable.js in JavaScript or persistent data structures in Haskell provide efficient ways to work with immutable data.

**2. Pure Functions:**

* **Functions should return the same output for the same input, every time.** This makes functions predictable and testable.
* **Avoid side effects:** Side effects are actions that change the state of the program outside the function's scope (e.g., modifying global variables, performing I/O). Isolate side effects to specific parts of your application.

**3. Declarative Programming:**

* **Focus on "what" to do, not "how" to do it.** This makes code more concise and easier to understand.
* **Use higher-order functions:** Functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions. This allows for powerful abstractions and code reuse.

**4. Composition:**

* **Combine small, reusable functions to create larger, more complex functionality.**
* **Use function composition operators:**  These operators allow you to chain functions together in a readable and concise way.

**5. Recursion:**

* **Use recursion to iterate over data structures.** This can be more elegant and efficient than traditional loops in some cases.

**6. Pattern Matching:**

* **Use pattern matching to concisely handle different data scenarios.** This can make code more readable and maintainable.

**7. Type Systems:**

* **Leverage strong type systems to prevent errors and improve code reliability.** TypeScript and Haskell both offer powerful type systems.

**8. Testing:**

* **Focus on unit testing pure functions.**  This is generally easier than testing functions with side effects.
* **Use property-based testing:**  This technique tests functions against a set of properties, ensuring they behave correctly for a wide range of inputs.

## Examples:

**TypeScript:**

```typescript
// Immutable data structure using Immutable.js
import { Map } from 'immutable';

const state = Map({ count: 0 });
const newState = state.set('count', state.get('count') + 1);

// Pure function
const add = (a: number, b: number): number => a + b;

// Higher-order function
const map = <T, U>(f: (x: T) => U, xs: T[]): U[] => xs.map(f);
```

**Haskell:**

```haskell
-- Immutable data structure
data Tree a = Empty | Node a (Tree a) (Tree a)

-- Pure function
add :: Int -> Int -> Int
add a b = a + b

-- Higher-order function
map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
map f xs = [f x | x <- xs]

-- Pattern matching
factorial :: Int -> Int
factorial 0 = 1
factorial n = n * factorial (n - 1)
```
