> Task: Make a guide on how to develop an application using TypeScript in FP style. This guide is for Rust developers so please show tips for strict type safe programming.

# Response

Creating an application using TypeScript in a functional programming (FP) style can be a rewarding experience, especially for developers coming from a Rust background. Rust developers are accustomed to a strong type system, immutability by default, and pattern matching, all of which align well with FP principles. TypeScript, while being a superset of JavaScript, can be tailored to enforce a strict type system similar to Rust, making it a suitable choice for Rust developers looking to apply their skills in the JavaScript ecosystem.

### Step 1: Setup Your TypeScript Environment

1. **Install Node.js and npm**: Ensure that Node.js is installed on your system. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Initialize a new Node.js project**:
   ```bash
   mkdir my-ts-app
   cd my-ts-app
   npm init -y
   ```

3. **Install TypeScript**:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev typescript
   ```

4. **Create a TypeScript config file**:
   ```bash
   npx tsc --init
   ```
   Enable strict options in `tsconfig.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "compilerOptions": {
       "target": "es6",
       "module": "commonjs",
       "strict": true,
       "esModuleInterop": true,
       "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true
     }
   }
   ```

### Step 2: Embrace TypeScript for Type Safety

TypeScript’s type system is powerful and supports advanced types that can be used to enforce strict typing:

- **Basic Types**: Start by defining simple types such as `string`, `number`, `boolean`, etc.
- **Interface and Types**: Define complex types using interfaces or type aliases.
- **Generics**: Use generics to create reusable and type-safe functions and classes.
- **Utility Types**: Leverage TypeScript’s utility types like `Partial`, `Readonly`, `Record`, and more to enforce immutability and other constraints.

Example of a type-safe function:
```typescript
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
}

function getUser(id: number): Readonly<User> {
  return { id, name: "Alice" };
}
```

### Step 3: Functional Programming Techniques

1. **Immutability**: Use `const` for declaring variables, and avoid using methods that mutate objects or arrays directly. Use functional helpers from libraries like Ramda or lodash/fp.

2. **Pure Functions**: Ensure your functions have no side effects. Each function should return a new value based on its inputs.

3. **Higher-Order Functions**: Utilize functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions.

4. **Currying and Partial Application**: Break down functions into smaller, reusable, and composable functions.

Example using Ramda for a curried function:
```typescript
import R from 'ramda';

const add = R.curry((a: number, b: number): number => a + b);
const addFive = add(5);
console.log(addFive(3)); // 8
```

### Step 4: Use FP Libraries

Consider using libraries that embrace FP principles:

- **Ramda**: Offers utility functions for working in a functional style.
- **fp-ts**: Provides developers with TypeScript modules for functional programming, including type-safe error handling, monads, and more.

Example using fp-ts:
```typescript
import { pipe } from 'fp-ts/function';
import * as O from 'fp-ts/Option';

const getUserEmail = (user: User): O.Option<string> =>
  pipe(
    user,
    O.fromNullable,
    O.map(u => u.email)
  );
```

### Step 5: Testing and Further Validation

- **Unit Testing**: Use Jest or Mocha with Chai for testing. Ensure your functions behave as expected.
- **Type Testing**: Use tools like `dtslint` to test your TypeScript definitions.

### Step 6: Build and Deployment

- Configure your `package.json` to include build scripts:
  ```json
  {
    "scripts": {
      "build": "tsc",
      "start": "node ./build/app.js"
    }
  }
  ```
- Use tools like Webpack or Rollup for bundling if targeting the browser.

### Conclusion

Adopting FP in TypeScript provides robust type safety and immutability, akin to what you're used to in Rust. By leveraging TypeScript's advanced types and functional libraries, you can create maintainable and scalable applications. Always keep exploring TypeScript's evolving features to enhance your functional programming practices.
