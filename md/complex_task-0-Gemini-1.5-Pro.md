## Top 5 Most Liked Programming Languages in 2023 (Stack Overflow Survey)

This document compares the top 5 most liked programming languages based on the Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2023. The "Loved vs. Dreaded" section of the survey reveals which languages developers want to continue working with. 

Here's a comparison of the top 5:

| Rank | Language | Loved (%) | Features | Website |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Rust | 87.0% | Memory safety, performance, concurrency, reliability, rich type system, modern tooling | [https://www.rust-lang.org/](https://www.rust-lang.org/) |
| 2 | Python | 67.3% | Beginner-friendly, versatile, extensive libraries, strong community, data science and machine learning focus | [https://www.python.org/](https://www.python.org/) |
| 3 | TypeScript | 73.5% | Statically typed, improved code structure, enhanced readability, scalability, transpiles to JavaScript | [https://www.typescriptlang.org/](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) |
| 4 | C# | 63.4% | Object-oriented, component-oriented, type-safe, garbage collection, extensive libraries, .NET framework | [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) |
| 5 | Kotlin | 63.1% | Concise syntax, null safety, interoperability with Java, Android development focus, coroutines for asynchronous programming | [https://kotlinlang.org/](https://kotlinlang.org/) |
