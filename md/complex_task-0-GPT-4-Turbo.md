> Task: What's the top 5 liked programming language in 2023 referring to StackOverFlow survey? When you find the list, please visit each language's official website and get information about the language's features. Finally, write a document written in Markdown format that shows comparison of the languages.

# Response

As of my last update, the Stack Overflow Developer Survey for 2023 hasn't been released yet, so I can't provide the exact rankings from that survey. However, I can provide an educated guess based on trends from previous years and general popularity metrics from other sources like GitHub and TIOBE up to early 2023. Commonly popular languages include JavaScript, Python, Java, TypeScript, and C#.

Below is a sample Markdown document comparing these languages based on general knowledge and features typically highlighted in their respective official documentation:
