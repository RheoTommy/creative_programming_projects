### Best Practices for Developing Applications in Functional Programming (FP)

Functional programming (FP) is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data. Here are some best practices for developing applications using the FP style:

1. **Immutability**: Avoid mutable state. Use immutable data structures and pure functions, which return new data structures instead of altering the existing ones.

2. **Pure Functions**: Ensure that functions have no side effects and that the output is only determined by the input values. This makes your code predictable and easy to test.

3. **Higher-Order Functions**: Leverage higher-order functions that can take other functions as arguments or return them. This helps in creating flexible and reusable code.

4. **Declarative Code Style**: Write code that describes what to do, rather than how to do it. This makes the code more readable and maintainable.

5. **Recursion Over Looping**: Use recursion for iterations instead of loops, which is a natural fit for functional languages and helps in maintaining immutability.

6. **Type Systems**: Use strong static type systems available in languages like Haskell or TypeScript to catch errors at compile time and to make the code more maintainable.

7. **Modularity**: Write small, reusable functions that perform one task and compose them to build more complex functionality.

8. **Lazy Evaluation**: Utilize lazy evaluation features present in languages like Haskell to improve the performance of your application, especially when dealing with large data sets.

### Example Code

#### TypeScript Example
TypeScript supports FP style through its advanced type system and ES6 features. Here is an example of a pure function in TypeScript:

```typescript
const add = (a: number, b: number): number => a + b;

const multiply = (a: number, b: number): number => a * b;

// Using the functions in a pure manner
const result = multiply(add(1, 2), 3); // Output: 9
```

#### Haskell Example
Haskell is a purely functional programming language. Here is how you might write similar functionality in Haskell:

```haskell
add :: Int -> Int -> Int
add a b = a + b

multiply :: Int -> Int -> Int
multiply a b = a * b

-- Using the functions
result :: Int
result = multiply (add 1 2) 3 -- Output: 9
```
