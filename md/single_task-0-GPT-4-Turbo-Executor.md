# Response

It seems there was an issue retrieving the search results. I will attempt to provide a general overview based on existing knowledge and include examples in TypeScript and Haskell.

### Best Practices for Developing Applications in Functional Programming (FP) Style

1. **Immutability**: Always use immutable data structures. This ensures that data doesn't change unexpectedly and helps to avoid side effects.

2. **Pure Functions**: Functions should be pure, meaning the same input will always produce the same output, without modifying any state outside the function.

3. **Higher-Order Functions**: Use functions that take other functions as arguments or return them as results. This is useful for creating modular and reusable code.

4. **Recursion over Looping**: Prefer recursion for iterations instead of loops. FP languages optimize for recursive functions to be as efficient as iterative loops.

5. **Type Systems**: Leverage the type systems (if available, as in Haskell or TypeScript) to ensure correctness and safety of the code.

6. **State Management**: Manage state in a controlled manner. If state needs to be changed, use controlled effects or specific state management libraries designed for FP.

### TypeScript Example
TypeScript supports FP styles by utilizing its type system and ES6+ features. Here's a simple example:

```typescript
// A pure function to calculate the sum of an array
const sum = (numbers: number[]): number => numbers.reduce((acc, val) => acc + val, 0);

// Usage of immutable data
const originalArray = Object.freeze([1, 2, 3, 4]);
const newArray = originalArray.concat(5); // Creating a new array instead of modifying the original

console.log(sum(newArray)); // Output: 10
```

### Haskell Example
Haskell is inherently a functional programming language, which enforces many FP principles by design:

```haskell
-- A pure function to calculate factorial using recursion
factorial :: Integer -> Integer
factorial 0 = 1
factorial n = n * factorial (n - 1)

main = print (factorial 5)  -- Output: 120
```

These examples illustrate basic FP principles in both a statically typed script language like TypeScript and a purely functional language like Haskell.

For more detailed and specific best practices, you might want to refer to resources and books dedicated to functional programming in these languages. Some good sources for further reading include:

- "Mostly adequate guide to FP (in javascript)" by Professor Frisby
- "Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!" by Miran Lipovača
- "Functional Programming in Scala" by Paul Chiusano and Rúnar Bjarnason

These resources can provide deeper insights into functional programming paradigms and practices.
