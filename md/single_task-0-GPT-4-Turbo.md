# Response

Functional Programming (FP) is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. It emphasizes the application of functions, in contrast to the imperative programming style, which emphasizes changes in state.

### Best Practices for Developing an Application in FP Style

1. **Immutability**: Avoid changing variables or object states after they have been created. Instead, use functions to return new objects with the updated state.

2. **Pure Functions**: Ensure functions have no side effects, which means the same inputs will always result in the same outputs, and there are no changes or interactions with anything outside the function.

3. **Higher-Order Functions**: Utilize functions that take other functions as arguments or return them as results. This helps in creating modular, reusable code.

4. **Recursion Over Looping**: Prefer using recursion for repeated or looping operations, as it fits well with the statelessness of functional programming.

5. **Function Composition**: Build complex operations by composing multiple functions, often leading to more readable and maintainable code.

6. **Type Systems**: Leverage the type systems in functional languages for better code safety and clarity. This includes using algebraic data types and type inference where applicable.

7. **Lazy Evaluation**: Use lazy evaluation to improve performance, particularly in handling large datasets or complex algorithms, by delaying computation until it's actually necessary.

8. **Referential Transparency**: Ensure that functions are referentially transparent, i.e., they can be replaced with their corresponding values without changing the program's behavior.

### Examples in TypeScript and Haskell

#### TypeScript Example

TypeScript supports functional programming styles, leveraging its powerful type system. Here’s how you might implement a simple task using FP principles in TypeScript:

```typescript
// Immutable data structure
type Person = {
    name: string;
    age: number;
};

// Pure function to increment age
const birthday = (person: Person): Person => ({
    ...person,
    age: person.age + 1
});

// Example usage
const person: Person = { name: "Alice", age: 30 };
const olderPerson = birthday(person);

console.log(olderPerson); // { name: "Alice", age: 31 }
console.log(person); // { name: "Alice", age: 30 }
```

#### Haskell Example

Haskell is a purely functional programming language, which naturally enforces many FP best practices. Here’s the equivalent functionality in Haskell:

```haskell
-- Define a data type for Person
data Person = Person { name :: String, age :: Int } deriving (Show)

-- Pure function to increment age
birthday :: Person -> Person
birthday (Person name age) = Person name (age + 1)

-- Example usage
main :: IO ()
main = do
    let person = Person "Alice" 30
    let olderPerson = birthday person
    print olderPerson -- Person {name = "Alice", age = 31}
    print person -- Person {name = "Alice", age = 30}
```
