# Response

Functional Programming (FP) is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. It emphasizes the application of functions, in contrast to the imperative programming style, which emphasizes changes in state. Here are some best practices for developing an application in FP style, with examples in TypeScript (a superset of JavaScript that includes static types) and Haskell (a standardized pure functional programming language).

### Best Practices for Functional Programming

1. **Immutability**: Avoid mutating data. Use immutable data structures and pure functions that return new data instead of altering the original data.

2. **Pure Functions**: Ensure that your functions are pure. This means functions should have no side effects (such as modifying global variables or I/O operations) and the same input should always return the same output.

3. **Function Composition**: Build complex operations out of simpler functions. This enhances code reusability and testability.

4. **Higher-Order Functions**: Use functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions as results. This is useful for creating utility functions that can be more dynamic and adaptable to different situations.

5. **Type Systems**: Leverage the type systems in TypeScript and Haskell to make illegal states unrepresentable and improve the robustness of your code through compile-time checks.

6. **Recursion Over Iteration**: Prefer recursion over traditional looping constructs. Many functional languages optimize recursion and can handle it more efficiently than imperative loops.

7. **Lazy Evaluation**: Use lazy evaluation to defer computation until necessary, which can lead to performance improvements and the ability to create infinite data structures.

8. **Avoiding Nulls**: Instead of using null or other similar constructs, use types like `Option` or `Maybe` which explicitly handle the absence of value.

### Examples

#### TypeScript Example

Here’s a simple example in TypeScript showing immutability, pure functions, and higher-order functions:

```typescript
type Book = {
    title: string,
    author: string,
    year: number
};

const books: Book[] = [
    { title: "Functional Programming", author: "John Doe", year: 2021 },
    { title: "Advanced TypeScript", author: "Jane Doe", year: 2019 }
];

// Pure function to filter books by year
const booksAfterYear = (bookList: Book[], year: number): Book[] =>
    bookList.filter(book => book.year > year);

// Using the function
const recentBooks = booksAfterYear(books, 2020);
console.log(recentBooks);
```

#### Haskell Example

This example in Haskell demonstrates immutability, pure functions, and recursion:

```haskell
data Book = Book {
    title :: String,
    author :: String,
    year :: Int
} deriving (Show)

books :: [Book]
books = [
    Book "Functional Programming" "John Doe" 2021,
    Book "Advanced Haskell" "Jane Doe" 2019
    ]

-- Pure function to filter books by year
booksAfterYear :: [Book] -> Int -> [Book]
booksAfterYear [] _ = []
booksAfterYear (b:bs) year
    | year < year b = b : booksAfterYear bs year
    | otherwise = booksAfterYear bs year

-- Using the function
main :: IO ()
main = print $ booksAfterYear books 2020
```
