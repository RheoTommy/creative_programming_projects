## Functional Programming in TypeScript for Rustaceans

This guide will walk you through developing a TypeScript application using functional programming (FP) principles, focusing on aspects familiar to Rust developers like strong typing and immutability.

**Why FP in TypeScript?**

TypeScript, while not purely functional, offers features conducive to FP:

* **Static Typing:** Like Rust, TypeScript's type system allows for compile-time error catching and enhanced code clarity.
* **Immutability:** Libraries like Immer enable easy immutable data manipulation, crucial for FP.
* **Higher-order Functions:** TypeScript supports passing functions as arguments and returning them, enabling functional composition.

**Key Concepts:**

1. **Immutability:**  Avoid mutating data. Use libraries like Immer to create new data structures based on existing ones, preserving the original.
2. **Pure Functions:** Ensure functions always return the same output for the same input and have no side effects. This enhances testability and predictability.
3. **Function Composition:** Combine smaller, reusable functions to build complex logic. This promotes modularity and code reuse.
4. **Currying:** Break down functions with multiple arguments into a series of functions, each taking one argument. This enhances function reusability and partial application.

**TypeScript Equivalents for Rust Concepts:**

| Rust Concept | TypeScript Equivalent | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Enums | Enums | Similar functionality, defining a type with specific variants |
| Structs | Interfaces/Classes | Interfaces define data structure, classes add methods |
| Traits | Interfaces | Define shared behavior across types |
| Generics | Generics | Allow for type-safe reusable code |
| Option<T> | `T \| undefined` | Represents potentially absent values |
| Result<T, E> |  Not built-in, use libraries like `neverthrow` or custom implementations |  Handles success/error scenarios |

**Example: Building a Todo List App**

Let's build a simple Todo list app using FP principles:

```typescript
import { produce } from 'immer';

// Define Todo type
interface Todo {
  id: number;
  text: string;
  completed: boolean;
}

// State of the application
interface AppState {
  todos: Todo[];
}

// Initial state
const initialState: AppState = {
  todos: [],
};

// Pure function to add a todo
const addTodo = (state: AppState, text: string): AppState => 
  produce(state, draft => {
    draft.todos.push({
      id: Date.now(),
      text,
      completed: false,
    });
  });

// Pure function to toggle todo completion
const toggleTodo = (state: AppState, id: number): AppState =>
  produce(state, draft => {
    const todoIndex = draft.todos.findIndex(todo => todo.id === id);
    if (todoIndex !== -1) {
      draft.todos[todoIndex].completed = !draft.todos[todoIndex].completed;
    }
  });

// Function to render the todo list (not pure, interacts with DOM)
const renderTodoList = (state: AppState) => {
  // ... Implementation to render the todo list in the UI
};

// Example usage
let state = initialState;
state = addTodo(state, 'Buy groceries');
state = addTodo(state, 'Write report');
state = toggleTodo(state, state.todos[0].id);

renderTodoList(state);
```

**Tips for Strict Type Safety:**

* **Leverage TypeScript's type system:** Use interfaces, enums, and generics extensively to define data structures and function signatures.
* **Avoid `any` type:**  Be explicit about the types you're working with to catch errors early.
* **Use type guards:**  Narrow down types within conditional branches for more precise type checking.
* **Explore libraries like `fp-ts` and `io-ts`:** These offer advanced functional programming constructs and runtime type validation.

**Moving Forward:**

* **Explore functional libraries:** `fp-ts`, `Ramda`, and `Lodash/fp` offer utilities for functional programming in TypeScript.
* **Practice immutability:** Embrace libraries like Immer to enforce immutability and simplify state management.
* **Think in terms of composition:** Break down problems into smaller, reusable functions and combine them for elegant solutions.

By combining TypeScript's type system with functional programming principles, you can build robust, maintainable applications that leverage the strengths of both paradigms.
